Contributing
My goal is to keep Ivy as small and simple as possible so I almost certainly won't accept pull requests. Ivy's plugin system makes it extremely flexible, however, so there's a good chance any feature you want to add can be written as an extension. (Let me know if you find you need an extra event or filter hook to make an extension work.)
